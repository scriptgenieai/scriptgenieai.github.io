        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        
        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>All user data is stored on your local device and managed using the Chrome.storage API:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>API keys and model configuration information are stored locally and are not uploaded to our servers</li>
            <li>Scripts and conversation history you create are saved in local storage</li>
            <li>Script snapshots, version history, and personalized settings are saved only on your device</li>
            <li>Tab script matching information is temporarily stored locally</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>When you use the extension to interact with AI models, your prompts and conversation content will be sent to the third-party AI service providers you configure (such as OpenAI, Claude, etc.). These transmissions are subject to the privacy policies of the respective service providers. We recommend that you review these service providers' privacy policies to understand how they handle your data.</p>
        
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Important Note</strong>: We do not collect, store, or transmit your API keys to our servers. All API keys are stored and used only on your local device.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We highly value your data security and take the following comprehensive measures to protect your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensitive Information Protection</strong>: Sensitive information such as API keys are masked when displayed (showing only the last 4 digits), ensuring that complete keys are not exposed even during screen sharing</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal Permissions Principle</strong>: We strictly adhere to the principle of minimal permissions, requesting only permissions necessary for the extension's functionality and not requesting additional permissions unrelated to functionality</li>
            <li><strong>Local Data Storage</strong>: All user data is stored only on your local device; we do not transfer or store your personal data on our servers</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Storage Mechanism</strong>: We use Chrome's secure storage API to protect local data and prevent unauthorized access</li>
            <li><strong>Sandbox Execution Environment</strong>: All scripts are executed in a secure sandbox environment provided by Chrome to prevent malicious code execution</li>
            <li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Sensitive information stored locally is encrypted, adding an extra layer of security</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Reviews</strong>: We regularly review the extension code to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities</li>
